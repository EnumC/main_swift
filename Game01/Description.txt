	This is a game focused on strategy, and agility. 

	This game is similar to ALONE(A rocket game obstacle avoidance thingy.)

	Here is what the game will be roughly about:

	1. The player is mounted on a forward-thrust rocket, and after blast off, the player will have to control the rocket's movement, and needs to avoid the surrounding obstacle.
	2. The player can *Optionally* collect resources that is spreaded throughout the level, and can use that resources to upgrade their ship at the end of each game.
	3. The player wins when they reach the very end of the map.
